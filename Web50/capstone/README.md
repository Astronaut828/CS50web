## Sections

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

My Portfolio stands out due to its integration of a dynamic gallery and typewriter-style introduction display, which offer a visually engaging user experience uncommon in traditional portfolio sites. The complexity of this project is evident in its blend of aesthetics and functionality, requiring mastery of both front-end design and back-end development as well as the usage of multiple languages and frameworks.

## File Structure

- `layout.html`: This is the base HTML file from which other pages in my portfolio extend. It includes key elements such as the <head> with link and script references, a header with a title, a navigation bar with links to various sections of my portfolio page, a contact form inside a modal, and a {% block content %} placeholder where content from other pages is inserted. This file essentially provides the consistent structure and style for my portfolio pages.

- `index.html`: This file represents the home page of my portfolio. It extends from the base layout.html and features an autoplaying, muted gif element and a typewriter-style text animation. This interactivity is made possible through JavaScript and provides an engaging introduction to my portfolio.

- `about.html`: This file constructs the "About Me" page of my portfolio. It extends from the base layout.html, and contains a heading, an image, and a paragraph of text that offer insight into my background and experiences.

- `portfolio.html`: This page is an extension of layout.html and is where I showcase my professional and personal projects. It includes an introductory paragraph about the portfolio, a row of photos, and a list of project links. It serves as an overview and representation of my work and experiences.

- `spotlight.html`: This page extends from layout.html and is dedicated to displaying a collection of blog-style posts and features that showcase my work and interests. I use Django's template language to loop over the posts context variable and generate HTML for each individual post.

Pagination: This navigation system allows users to click through multiple pages of posts. It leverages Django's built-in pagination features to create clickable links that let users navigate to the next and previous page, as well as the first and last pages.

- `style / modal / spotlight.css`: These CSS files style all HTML pages, providing a consistent look and feel across my portfolio.

- `app.js`: This JavaScript file manages interactivity throughout the portfolio, including the dynamic gallery and contact form.

- `images/`: This directory contains all images used across the portfolio.
